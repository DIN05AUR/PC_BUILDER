PC BUILDER is an AI inspired expert system that helps users build their PC who have whatsoever no knowledge or background in IT or computers. The goal is to help them build their PC even though when they have little to no knowledge about computers or the underlying hardware configurations.

Then there are few more questions considering the budget, preference and priorities of the user and thus in the final step, a fully built and customized PC configuration quotation is displayed.
